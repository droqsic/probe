Probe is a lightweight, cross-platform Go library for detecting whether a file descriptor is connected to a terminal. It is designed for high performance, thread safety, and ease of use in modern Go applications.

## Features

- ‚ö° **High Performance** ‚Äî Fast terminal detection with intelligent result caching
- üåç **Cross-Platform** ‚Äî Works seamlessly on Windows, macOS, Linux, BSD, and more
- üßµ **Thread-Safe** ‚Äî Fully safe for concurrent use across goroutines
- üß† **Zero Allocations** ‚Äî Designed to avoid heap allocations entirely
- üß© **Minimal Dependencies** ‚Äî Built using only the Go standard library and x/sys
- üßº **Simple API** ‚Äî Clean and intuitive interface for fast integration

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/droqsic/probe
```

## Usage

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"

    "github.com/droqsic/probe"
)

func main() {
    // Check if standard streams are terminals
    if probe.IsTerminal(os.Stdout.Fd()) {
        fmt.Println("Stdout is a terminal")
    } else {
        fmt.Println("Stdout is not a terminal (redirected to a file or pipe)")
    }

    // On Windows, check for Cygwin/MSYS2 terminals
    if probe.IsCygwinTerminal(os.Stdout.Fd()) {
        fmt.Println("Running in a Cygwin/MSYS2 terminal")
    }
}
```

## Performance

Probe is engineered for speed. Its caching layer makes repeated checks on the same file descriptor nearly instantaneous. Here are benchmark results under typical usage:

```
BenchmarkIsTerminal                       89545555	        13.61 ns/op	       0 B/op	      0 allocs/op
BenchmarkIsCygwinTerminal                 89867444	        13.68 ns/op	       0 B/op	      0 allocs/op
```

These results demonstrate Probe's ultra-low overhead and suitability for high-throughput applications.

## How It Works

Probe uses platform-specific mechanisms for terminal detection:

- **Unix-like systems**: Uses appropriate ioctl calls (`TIOCGETA`, `TCGETS`, or `TCGETA`)
- **Windows**: Uses the Win32 `GetConsoleMode` function
- **Cygwin/MSYS2**: Detects special named pipes used by Cygwin terminals
- **WebAssembly**: Detects terminals based on Node.js environment variables
- **Other platforms**: Always returns `false`

All results are cached after the first check per file descriptor to avoid repeated syscalls.

## Supported Platforms

| Platform       | Support | Implementation    |
| -------------- | ------- | ----------------- |
| Windows        | ‚úÖ      | `GetConsoleMode`  |
| Linux          | ‚úÖ      | `TCGETS` ioctl    |
| Android        | ‚úÖ      | `TCGETS` ioctl    |
| macOS (Darwin) | ‚úÖ      | `TIOCGETA` ioctl  |
| iOS            | ‚úÖ      | `TIOCGETA` ioctl  |
| FreeBSD        | ‚úÖ      | `TIOCGETA` ioctl  |
| OpenBSD        | ‚úÖ      | `TIOCGETA` ioctl  |
| NetBSD         | ‚úÖ      | `TIOCGETA` ioctl  |
| DragonFly BSD  | ‚úÖ      | `TIOCGETA` ioctl  |
| Hurd           | ‚úÖ      | `TIOCGETA` ioctl  |
| z/OS           | ‚úÖ      | `TIOCGETA` ioctl  |
| Solaris        | ‚úÖ      | `TCGETA` ioctl    |
| Illumos        | ‚úÖ      | `TCGETA` ioctl    |
| Haikou         | ‚úÖ      | `TCGETA` ioctl    |
| AIX            | ‚úÖ      | `TCGETA` ioctl    |
| Plan9          | ‚úÖ      | `Fd2path`         |
| WebAssembly    | ‚úÖ      | Node.js detection |

Other platforms will compile but terminal detection will always return `false`.

## Thread Safety

Probe is built with concurrency in mind. It uses a read-write mutex to protect its internal cache, allowing many goroutines to read in parallel while safely handling updates. The design ensures scalability and efficiency for read-heavy workloads.
